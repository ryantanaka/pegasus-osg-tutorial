TODO:
- install latest pegasus from tarball on login04
- create script to export PATH of that pegasus install
- create 1 markdown file with all the steps in the tutorial 
    (basicaly a cheat sheet where people can just copy and paste things
       to run as we move a long)
- create sample workflow and upload to GITHUB

OUTLINE
-------
1. High Level Overview
    - distributed computing network of mostly universities and national labs
        who contribute their local compute resources when they are not being 
        used by local users 
        - some resources may be dedicated to OSG while others may be used only
            when they are sitting idle (like over the weekend)

    - to use OSG, you just need to be affiliated with a United States research
        institution (university or lab) 

    - to access OSG you don't have to contribute resources

    - "Submit locally, Run globally": researchers can submit batch jobs from their
        home institution - or OSG-provided submit points - in order to access their
        local resources and expand elastically out to the OSG

    - some stats
        - provided more than 1.2 billion cpu hours in last 12 months
        - consists of computing and storage elements at over 100 individual
            sites spanning the United States

    - OSG Connect is the entrypoint in OSG

    - tradeoff
        - don't know exactly where job will run 
        - can't garuantee that you will have enough time for your job to
            finish

    - individual files per job can be up to 10s of GB
